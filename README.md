- Takes a directory tree with RAR and ZIP archives in it and extracts them
- Tries to guess filename encoding for non-utf8 ZIP files and converts to utf8
- Properly puts stuff into a folder, if the archive has more than one top-level file

Extremely hacky and hardly tested, please read the help text and/or code before use.
